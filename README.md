# Blinkit Dashboard - Data Analysis and Visualization Project
This project involves creating an interactive dashboard to analyze Blinkit data, focusing on sales performance, customer behavior, and operational insights. The dashboard is built using Power BI, with data processing and transformation done through SQL and Excel. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making by providing clear visualizations and actionable insights.

# Features
Sales Analysis: Detailed view of sales trends over time, including daily, weekly, and monthly sales breakdowns. Insights into top-selling products, revenue by category, and sales performance across different regions.
Customer Behavior: Analysis of customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and average order values. Identification of high-value customers and loyalty trends.
Operational Efficiency: Evaluation of delivery times, order processing durations, and supply chain efficiency metrics.
Interactive Visualizations: Interactive charts, graphs, and filters to allow users to explore data dynamically.
Custom KPIs: Key performance indicators (KPIs) for quick insights into metrics like average order value, customer retention rate, and daily active users.

# Tools and Technologies:
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard development.
SQL: To query and manipulate the data.
Excel: For data cleaning and initial analysis.

# Dataset:
The dataset includes anonymized sales data, customer information, and operational metrics from Blinkit. It has been preprocessed to remove any personally identifiable information.

# Insights:
Identified trends in peak sales periods and customer preferences.
Optimized delivery routes based on analysis of order locations and delivery times.
Suggested improvements in product stocking based on sales patterns.

# Future Work:
Integrating real-time data streaming for live updates.
Adding predictive analytics features using machine learning models.
Expanding the dashboard to include marketing campaign analysis.
